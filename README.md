# Flood_Resilience_Game
Experience, explore, and learn about community flood resilience!
Why?
The question how to link the development and growth with disaster risk management is not easy. Often problems and solutions for flood-prone communities are focused only on the role of hard infrastructure.
Other aspects, like social, natural, human and financial capital are frequently ignored, and the role of the cooperation sparked by bonds between the community members is underestimated. Also, long-term planning often gives way to immediate actions that lead to improving safety for short time, but fail in the long run.
Understanding resilience is not easy! It requires a change in thinking.
